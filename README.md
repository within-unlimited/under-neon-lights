# Under Neon Lights
A snapshot of [Under Neon Lights](https://jonobr1.github.io/under-neon-lights), an interactive WebVR Music Video.

## Project
In order to create this project, the Within Team relied heavily on two open-source lirbaries: [Three.js](http://threejs.org) and [Frame.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/frame.js). We've taken our output which includes code and models and laid it out into the Frame.js editor which you can play around with here:
